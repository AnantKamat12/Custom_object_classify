Object Detection with TensorFlow Lite

This repository contains code for performing real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite. The project includes scripts for both TensorFlow and TensorFlow Lite models.

Features:

Real-time object detection using a pre-trained TensorFlow Lite model
Webcam integration for live object detection
Supports various object classes with customizable confidence thresholds
Requirements:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
OpenCV
Usage:

It is advised to create a new anaconda environment
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the object detection script (object_detection.py) to perform real-time object detection using your webcam.
Feel free to contribute or raise issues if you encounter any problems!
